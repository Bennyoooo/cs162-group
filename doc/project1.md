## Task 1: Efficient Alarm Clock

### Data structures and functions

*Write down any variables, typedefs, or enumerations added or modified with a concise explanation, no pseudocode necessary.*

### Algorithms

*High level description of the algorithms and convince that they satisfy requirements and common edge cases. 1 paragraph for a simple task, 2 for a complex task.*

### Synchronization

*Describe rationality for preventing race conditions and convincing argument that it will work in all cases.*

### Rationale

*Discuss alternatives, pro’s/con’s, as well as whether it is easy, amount of coding, space time complexity, difficulty of extending design for additional features.*

---

## Task 2: Priority Scheduler

## Additional Questions:

1. *Prove the existence of priority donation bug in ***_sema_up()_*** function*

2. *Fill out table at **[https://gist.github.com/rogerhub/82395ea1f3ed64db677*9](https://gist.github.com/rogerhub/82395ea1f3ed64db6779)* *

3. *Which ambiguities were in #2 and what rules were used to resolve them?*
